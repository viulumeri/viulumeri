# Technology decisions

## 29.7.2025

### Express

Express for the backend.

### React

React for the frontend.

### MongoDB / Mongoose

Mongoose to connect to MongoDB. NoSQL suits our needs well, Postgres would be a bit overkill.

### Material UI

MUI is partially familiar from other projects and it's relatively easy to configure and use.

### Tone.js

Tone.js for the music player. It should integrate well with React and TS.

### TanStack Query

Familiar library from other projects, easy and clean code when things are setup.

### React Context

Goes well with TanStack.

### React Router

It's nice that the URL reflects what's going on in the app.

### Supertest

Standard test library, familiar from other projects.

### node-test

Should be more light-weight than Jest and it's native.

### TypeScript

Forces one to think more than plain JS.
